    Scenario: I can register a vehicle
        Given my fleet
        And a vehicle
        When I register this vehicle into my fleet
        Then this vehicle should be part of my vehicle fleet

    Scenario: I can't register same vehicle twice
        Given my fleet
        And a vehicle
        And I have registered this vehicle into my fleet
        When I try to register this vehicle into my fleet
        Then I should be informed this this vehicle has already been registered into my fleet
